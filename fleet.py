class Fleet:
    #Should store all ship information for a fleet.

    #Thinking about having 'ship merging' to some extent
    #E.g. if we have many small lasers we can probably merge that into single laser with combined damage and only a single cooldown
    #Maybe could do something similar for shields, armour, hull
    #Difficult to account for per ship buffs though, like fire rate, shield hardening etc.
